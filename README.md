# Natural Language Processing: PCL Approach
The final assignment for the class was to predict if a message is patronizing or condensending.  The dataset was part of the [SemEval2022 tasks](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2022/tasks): "Task 4: Patronizing and Condescending Language Detection".  My teammates and I tried 3 different attempts.  A short description of which can be found here: [Shared Task - PCL Detection, Cutter Dalton, Jay Seabrum, Weitung Liao.pdf](https://github.com/xjseabrum/nlp-files/blob/main/PCL/Shared%20Task%20-%20PCL%20Detection%2C%20Cutter%20Dalton%2C%20Jay%20Seabrum%2C%20Weitung%20Liao.pdf).  The code for the best attempt is located [here](https://github.com/xjseabrum/nlp-files/blob/main/PCL/SharedTask.py).

# Class Description and Syllabus
The class (which I took under Jim Martin at CU Boulder in Fall 2021) went over many topics of how NLP has progressed and evolved into where it is now.  The topics that were covered in the class were: RegEx, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Vector semantics, RNNs and Transformers, Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Constituency/Dependency parsing.  The full list of the topics covered can be found here: [Class_Syllabus_Schedule_NLP.PNG](https://github.com/xjseabrum/nlp-files/blob/main/Class_Syllabus_Schedule_NLP.PNG)

# Future Plans
I currently do not have any future plans to update this repository.  To see more about what I have done with some the NLP techniques that I have learned from this class, see either my [Neural Nets Deep Learning Repo](https://github.com/xjseabrum/nndl_final_project) or my [Computational Models of Discourse Repo](https://github.com/xjseabrum/comp_disc_S22_proj).
